# Crypto-Web-Scraping-Project

Find a 'scrappable' cryptocurrencies website where you can scrape the top 5 cryptocurrencies.
Scrape the information and create a well formatted Excel spreadsheet report.
The report should display the name of the currency, the symbol (if applicable),
the current price and % change in the last 24 hrs and corresponding price (based on % change)

Furthermore, for Bitcoin and Ethereum, the program should alert you via text if the value increases or decrease within $5 of its current value.
